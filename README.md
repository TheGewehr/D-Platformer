## DEV Diary

The developpement was smooth and everything was going well, but some functionalities were very dificult to implement, such as the GUI. Some of the implementations 
are imcomplete or still not work correctly, such as the sound. When you enter the options menu, and then you play you have a terrible bug, that is triggered by the scene manager, modules going wrong...
But if we do some trial, the game still playable.
Once we enter the menu, we have 3 buttons, 1rst to play, 2nd to open the options menu and then the 3rd, to quit.

The game plays as the last release but this time we added some functionalityes such as the shield and the win screen.


## Final Note

It is a bit messy, sorry about that :-(
If you have any question, let us know.
Thanks for this semester, we hope you the best ;-)
